# CHAPTER_6
Using Common Widgets

In this chapter, "Using Common Widgets" I learned about the most commonly used (basic) widgets. These basic widgets are the building blocks to designing mobile apps. I explored different types of buttons to choose depending on the situation. I learned how to add assets to your app via AssetBundle by listing items in the pubspec.yaml file. I used the Image widget to load images from the local device or a web server through a URL string. Saw how the Icon widget gives you the ability to load icons by using the MaterialIcons font library. To modify the appearance of widgets, you learned how to use BoxDecoration. To improve giving users feedback on data entry, I implemented InputDecoration. Validating multiple text field data entries can be cumbersome, but you can use the Form widget to manually or automatically validate them. Lastly, using MediaQuery to find out the current device orientation is extremely powerful in any mobile app to lay out widgets depending on the orientation. using common widgets in Flutter involves understanding and leveraging the building blocks for creating user interfaces. Widgets in Flutter are central to app development since everything in Flutter is a widget, from the smallest visual component to layout and even gestures.
